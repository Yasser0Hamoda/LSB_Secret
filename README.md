## 🧠 How it Works

1. **User Registration/Login**
2. **Embed Message**:
   - Upload image (PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP)
   - Enter a message and a password
   - The app compresses + encrypts + embeds the message
3. **Extract Message**:
   - Upload stego image
   - Enter password
   - The app decrypts and decompresses to reveal message
